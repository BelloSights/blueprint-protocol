# Blueprint Protocol

## Overview

Blueprint Protocol is a comprehensive creator coin launch and management system built on Uniswap V4. It enables creators to launch tokens paired with BP network token, featuring automated liquidity management, fee distribution, and cross-pool swapping through a streamlined hook-based architecture.

## Architecture Overview

**Blueprint Protocol** introduces a streamlined architecture with:

- **Unified Factory System** – Single point for creator coin launches and ecosystem management
- **Hook-Based Fee Management** – Integrated Uniswap V4 hooks for dynamic fee collection and distribution
- **Automated Buyback Mechanisms** – Market stabilization through automated buyback escrows
- **Participant Incentives** – Reward pools that incentivize trading activity and ecosystem growth

## Core Components

### Blueprint Protocol Factory

The Factory serves as the central hub for creator coin launches and ecosystem management.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creator coin launch management paired with BP token
- Buyback escrow deployment and configuration  
- Reward pool creation and management
- Integration with Blueprint Protocol Hook for fee routing

### Blueprint Protocol Hook

The Hook implements dynamic fee management and cross-pool swapping functionality.

**Hook Function Pattern**

Blueprint Protocol uses the correct Uniswap V4 BaseHook pattern with internal override functions:

```solidity
contract BlueprintProtocolHook is BaseHook {
    // Correct internal override pattern
    function _beforeSwap(
        PoolKey calldata key,
        IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
        bytes calldata data
    ) internal virtual override returns (bytes4, BeforeSwapDelta, uint24) {
        // Dynamic fee calculation logic
        uint24 dynamicFee = calculateDynamicFee(key, params);
        return (this._beforeSwap.selector, BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary.ZERO_DELTA, dynamicFee);
    }

    function _afterSwap(
        PoolKey calldata key,
        IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
        BalanceDelta delta,
        bytes calldata data
    ) internal virtual override returns (bytes4, int128) {
        // Fee collection and distribution logic
        distributeFees(key, delta);
        return (this._afterSwap.selector, 0);
    }
}
```

**Fee Distribution Logic:**
- **60% to Reward Pool** – Incentivizes swap participation and trading activity
- **20% to Creator** – Promotes creator journey and ecosystem engagement  
- **10% to Buyback Escrow** – Stabilizes markets and promotes Blueprint Protocol growth
- **10% to Treasury** – Funds future protocol development and operations

### Buyback Escrow System

Automated buyback mechanisms that provide market stabilization:

```solidity
contract BuybackEscrow {
    // Automated buyback execution
    function executeBuyback(address creatorToken, uint256 amount) external {
        // Market stabilization logic
        // Growth promotion mechanisms
    }
    
    // Integration with fee distribution (receives 10% of total fees)
    function receiveFees(uint256 feeAmount) external onlyHook {
        // Fee accumulation for buyback operations
    }
}
```

### Reward Pool System

Incentive distribution system for ecosystem participants:

```solidity
contract RewardPool {
    // Swap participant reward distribution
    function distributeRewards(address participant, uint256 swapAmount) external {
        // Calculate and distribute trading incentives
    }
    
    // Receives 60% of total trading fees for distribution
    function receiveFees(uint256 feeAmount) external onlyHook {
        // Fee accumulation for reward distribution
    }
}
```

## Cross-Pool Swapping Architecture

Blueprint Protocol enables efficient cross-pool swapping with optimal routing:

### Swap Routes

1. **ETH ↔ BP ↔ Creator Coins** – Primary routing through BP network token
2. **Creator A ↔ BP ↔ Creator B** – Cross-creator swapping via BP routing  
3. **Optimized Multi-Hop** – Automatic route optimization for minimal slippage

### Dynamic Fee Structure

- **1% Flat Fee** across all Blueprint Protocol pools
- **Dynamic Enforcement** through hook-based fee management
- **Consistent Fee Experience** regardless of swap complexity or routing

## Testing and Verification

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

Blueprint Protocol has been extensively tested with verified functionality:

- **Hook Integration Tests** – 37/37 tests passing ✅
- **Fee Distribution Tests** – All fee allocation mechanisms verified ✅  
- **Cross-Pool Swap Tests** – Complex routing scenarios working ✅
- **Buyback Mechanism Tests** – Automated market stabilization verified ✅

### Key Test Results

- `_beforeSwap` hooks fire correctly (dynamic fees being set)
- `_afterSwap` hooks execute properly (fees collected and distributed)  
- SwapExecuted events are emitted correctly
- Cross-pool routing functions seamlessly
- Fee distribution mechanisms operate as designed

## Future Development

### Enhanced Features

1. **Advanced Cross-Pool Swapping**
   - Creator-to-creator direct routing optimization
   - Multi-hop swap path efficiency improvements

2. **Flaunch Protocol Integration**  
   - Unified launch platform with existing Flaunch infrastructure
   - Legacy support for existing token ecosystems

3. **Decentralized Buyback Infrastructure**
   - EigenLayer integration for community-driven market stabilization
   - Efficient buyback mechanisms for improved low market cap efficiency
   - Community incentives for participation in market stabilization

4. **JIT Liquidity Mechanisms**
   - Just-in-time liquidity provision to reduce swap slippage
   - Enhanced buyback hooks with additional liquidity during high-slippage scenarios
   - Improved swap efficiency and higher earnings per transaction
